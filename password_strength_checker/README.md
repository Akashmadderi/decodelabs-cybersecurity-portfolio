# Decodelabs Internship - Task 1: Password Strength Checker

## Overview
This script is a robust Password Strength Checker designed to evaluate the security level of user-provided passwords. It categorizes passwords into Weak, Medium, or Strong tiers based on established cyber-security metrics.

## Key Requirements Met
* Evaluates password length.
* Detects the presence of uppercase letters, lowercase letters, numerical digits, and special symbols.
* Implements logical condition checks to calculate an overall entropy score.
* Provides immediate, clear feedback displaying the password strength result to the user.

## Technical Skills Demonstrated
* Advanced string handling and iteration.
* Boolean logic and condition checks.
* Fundamental security basics regarding brute-force mitigation and character space complexity.

## Execution Instructions
1. Ensure Python 3.x is installed on your system.
2. Open a terminal or IDE console.
3. Run the script using the command: `python task1_password_checker.py`
4. Enter test passwords when prompted to see real-time evaluation. Type 'exit' to terminate the process.
