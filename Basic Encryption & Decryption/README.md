## Decodelabs Internship - Task 2: Basic Encryption & Decryption

### Overview
This tool allows users to secure plaintext or decipher encrypted text by shifting the alphabet by a user-defined integer key. It correctly handles both uppercase and lowercase letters while ignoring special characters, numbers, and whitespace (leaving them unaltered in the output).

### Key Requirements Met
* Encrypts user text using a basic Caesar cipher logic.
* Decrypts the resulting ciphertext back to the original plaintext.
* Displays both the encrypted and decrypted outputs simultaneously for verification.

### Technical Skills Demonstrated
* Understanding of core encryption concepts (Plaintext, Ciphertext, Keys, Substitution Ciphers).
* Logic building using modular arithmetic and ASCII value manipulation.
* Application of data protection basics.

### Execution Instructions
1. Open a terminal or IDE console.
2. Run the script using the command: `python task2_caesar_cipher.py`
3. Enter the message you wish to encrypt. The console will output the encrypted string and the subsequent decrypted string.
