## Decodelabs Internship - Task 4: System Vulnerability Checklist

### Overview
This task provides an automated, interactive risk assessment checklist to audit system security. The script walks an auditor through critical security vectors and generates a vulnerability report based on the system's current configuration and user policies.

### Key Requirements Met
* Checks for the enforcement of strong password policies to mitigate weak passwords.
* Verifies software update status to ensure the system is patched against known vulnerabilities.
* Identifies unsafe user practices, such as credential sharing and lack of auto-lock mechanisms.

### Technical Skills Demonstrated
* Implementation of system security basics.
* Practical application of risk assessment and compliance auditing.
* Programmatic generation of actionable security reports.

### Execution Instructions
1. Open a terminal or IDE console.
2. Run the script using the command: `python task4_vulnerability_checklist.py`
3. Answer the interactive Yes/No prompts regarding the system's security posture.
4. Review the final generated Risk Assessment Report to identify vulnerabilities.
